# TeNOR User interface
This is the TeNOR user interface. Can be used for the management of the orchestrator, create descriptors, deploy services and monitor metrics.

##Requirements
 - Ruby
 - Bundler
 - Bower

##Installation steps
1. Install Ruby webserver and modules
First of all make sure that Ruby is installed in your system.

Then execute `bundle install` in order to install the ruby dependencies.

2. Configure the IPs
Copy the sample config file:
Run `cp app/config.js.sample app/config.js`
And edit the config.js with the correct IPs.

The UI uses the TeNOR Authentication. By default the UI has preconfigured the default user and password.

3. Execute the UI
Run `rake start` and the server will listen on port 9000 by default.

4. Login to your system

Visit the page http://127.0.0.1:9000 in your browser.

Default user: admin
Default password: adminpass

##Development

A bower.json is provided, so you can include more javascript dependencies with Bower:

Run `bower install`.
